      <description>Hello, is this thing on?
Alright, now that we&amp;rsquo;ve established that this is a place where I publicly write about my experiences, I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be interesting to start with &amp;ldquo;all the steps you need to do before you consider yourself doing micro-services the right way&amp;rdquo;.
Some background About a decade back, I was an entry-level software engineer. I was working alone on small projects, while I was breaking into all the new technologies.</description>

      <description>Yet another attempt to revive my blog and shed some light into stuff I&amp;rsquo;m working on and I personally find interesting. Consider this a personal challenge of myself to express in writing every day stuff that I do and attract my attention, and could potentially be professionally (or not) beneficial for others as well.
In this blog I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing mostly about:
 Python and Go best-practises Microservices and my experiences with service oriented architectures AWS deployments Kubernetes deployments and one thing or two that I pick up on my way  Feel free to DM me on Twitter if you have a topic you&amp;rsquo;d like me to elaborate on, or hop on a brainstorming video chat, or generally just exchange ideas about technologies.</description>
