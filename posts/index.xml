      <description>Yet another attempt to revive my blog and shed some light into stuff I&amp;rsquo;m working on and I personally find interesting. Consider this a personal challenge of myself to express in writing every day stuff that I do and attract my attention, and could potentially be professionally (or not) beneficial for others as well.

 Python and Go best-practises Microservices and my experiences with service oriented architectures AWS deployments Kubernetes deployments and one thing or two that I pick up on my way  Feel free to DM me on Twitter if you have a topic you&amp;rsquo;d like me to elaborate on, or hop on a brainstorming video chat, or generally just exchange ideas about technologies.</description>
